# MusicGame
Plays an arbitrary song from lyrion music server (https://lyrion.org/) without showing it
players can guess which song/artis/year it is
after pressing the button
title, artist, year and cover are shown
The player with the best guess wins the point
Management functions for players, points etc. are not yet part of the software

The server runs on python (can be packaged as a docker container)
You need to adapt server + player address
